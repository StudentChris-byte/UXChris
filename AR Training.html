        <p>A paper prototype was created, and an initial round of ‘think-aloud protocol’ usability testing covered both task flows:</p>
        <li>Viewing a Camera</li>
        <li>Creating and Reviewing a Freeze Frame</li>
        <p>Test participants were provided with the following scenario:</p>
        <p><i>”You are a student at the University of Winchester and requested camera training. You have downloaded an augmented reality mobile application on your phone, which the University recommended you attain the required training. 
            <br>In this usability test, you launch the application for the first time and explore its features. Please complete the introduction, view two cameras, and save your first ‘Freeze Frame’”.</i></p>
            <h4>Usability Testing Outcomes:</h4>
            <li><b>Misunderstanding of Visual Elements: </b>The ‘target’ is often mistaken for an object, likely due to the limitations of paper prototyping and drawing skills.</li>
            <li><b>Onboarding Process Clarity: </b>Users require repeated onboarding prompts to engage with the ‘Freeze Frame’ feature, indicating a need for more precise instructions on when the walkthrough ends.</li>
            <li><b>Storage vs Saving Confusion: </b>There’s confusion about whether a ‘Freeze Frame’ is saved within the app or to the device’s Camera Roll, suggesting a need for distinct terminology like ‘Save’ versus ‘Export’.</li>
            <li><b>Confirmation of Action: </b>Users are unsure if creating a ‘Freeze Frame’ saves the image, indicating a need for explicit confirmation and terminology clarification in the onboarding process.</li>

        <p>Further usability tests focused on the tester’s experience of basic app functionality and accessibility functions. 
            <br>Each test revealed where the tester would become confused or behave unintendedly. These issues must be rectified to prevent them from being distributed as a final-release candidate for the mobile application.</p>

    <p>During these tests, participants repeatedly attempted to swipe objects to rotate them instead of tapping them. Further research indicated that this had become an expected gestural functionality in both AR and VR experiences, so it was implemented in a later iteration.</p>

        <h3>Functionality Highlights</h3>
        <li>Users can access on-demand training using virtual assets.</li>
        <li>Training requirements can be met when the workload is high and technician or asset availability is low.</li>
        <li>Design patterns leverage learnt user behaviours from similar AR applications, enhancing recognition and control.</li>
