    During these tests, participants repeatedly attempted to swipe objects to rotate them instead of tapping them. Further research indicated that this had become an expected gestural functionality in both AR and VR experiences, so it was implemented in a later iteration.

        <h3 id="arPage">Final Design Highlights and Lessons Learned</h3>

        <h3>Functionality Highlights</h3>
        <li>Users can access on-demand training using virtual assets.</li>
        <li>Training requirements can be met when the workload is high and technician or asset availability is low.</li>
        <li>Design patterns leverage learnt user behaviours from similar AR applications, enhancing recognition and control.</li>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Usability and Accessibility Highlights</h3>
        <li>The “Freeze Frame” functionality allows users to pause the AR experience while they make observations in comfort.</li>
        <li>Gestural behaviours across other touchscreen systems have been integrated following usability test feedback.</li>
