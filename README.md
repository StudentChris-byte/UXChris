Hi, I'm Chris, and I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Winchester. I’m researching how eCommerce retailers can accommodate consumers’ need to touch products before purchasing them.

I've worked in education for 15 years, teaching college and university students photography, fine arts, and media. I'm currently lecturing on Digital Media and Human-Computer Interaction.

This page allows me to gather a portfolio, demonstrate UX and HCI projects, and record published research. Please take a look, and feel free to email me with any questions.
